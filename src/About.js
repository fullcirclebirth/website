            I believe that a womanâ€™s body was designed to grow and birth a baby. The process is 
            normal and not a pathological condition or one to be viewed and treated as an illness. 
            Yet, I recognize that we live in a broken world with bodies that do not always function 
            according to this design. For this reason I am thankful we have access to lifesaving 
            tools and resources. I hope to provide a Childbirth Education class that allows parents 
            to feel empowered and have positive feelings about the birthing process, a class that 
            promotes informed decision making based on all available options, and a class that provides 
            the most up to date information on evidence based care for mother and baby.

            My passion for supporting mothers started with the birth of my two children. 
            I enjoy caring for them, cooking and running.

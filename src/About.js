            I believe that a womanâ€™s body was designed to grow and birth a baby. The process 
            is normal and not a pathological condition or one to be viewed and treated as an illness. 
            Yet, I recognize that we live in a broken world with bodies that do not always function 
            according to this design. For this reason I am thankful we have access to lifesaving 
            tools and resources. They are tools in our tool box, but not ones we need to jump to 
            using with out necessity.

            When parents take my Childbirth Education class I provide information that allows parents 
            to feel empowered and have positive feelings about the birthing process, a class that 
            promotes informed decision making based on all available options, and a class that provides 
            the most up to date information on evidence based care for mother and baby.

            When I serve families as their Doula they can expect the mother to be the in the center of her 
            circle of care. My goal is to create a safe space in which the mother, her partner and her care 
            providers communicate respectfully and the mother is empowered to cope through the birthing process.
